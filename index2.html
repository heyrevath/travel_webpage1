                <p class="text">My wife and I just got back from a one week vacation in India. If I am to describe this vacation in one word it has to be: splendid! We had a great time. We enjoyed the sight-seeing, we savored the delicious Indian cuisine and we met new people; locals and from around the world! We want to deeply thank Tour My India for making this trip one of the best we ever had.
                    The program they prepared for us was not crowded and exhausting. We enjoyed seeing as much of India as we can while also finding time to relax. They also assigned us a great driver, Diwan, who did not spare any effort in ensuring we had a great time. Diwan spoke English, so while driving he continuously described our surroundings. He drove safely. The road trip from one city to another was delightful. Diwan answered all of our questions. He was polite, kind and professional in every sense. He even made sure to find us restaurants where we can eat Halal meat and chicken. Diwan went out of his way to make us happy. The moment he dropped us off at the airport felt like saying goodbye to an old friend.
                    We would also like to deeply thank Mr. Mavendra who prepared this program. He made sure to assign us a good driver and he kept in touch during our trip to ensure everything was going as planned.
                    Thank you Tour My India for allowing us to live this vivacious experience and see the true India.
                    Regards
                    Bashar Darawsheh,
                    Thank you once again!   </p>
